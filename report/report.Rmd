# Materials & Methods

## Acquisition of Public ChIP-seq Datasets

ChIP-seq was performed on genetically modified MCF7L cells (*insertion, using a lentiviral cDNA delivery system to express Dox-inducible FOXA1*) [@fu2019].
Datasets were deposited into the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA)[@leinonen2010] under accession no.
PRJNA512997 (Table \@ref(tab:data)).
Using "Genetic Manipulation Tools" within the Galaxy[@thegala2022] environment (v 23.0.rc1), SRAs were converted to FastQ files.
FastQ files were then aligned to the human genome assembly GRCh37 (hg19) using Bowtie2 (v 2.5.0)[@langmead2012] to output BAM files.

```{r data}
kbl(
  data.frame(
    "Experiment" = c(

### EaSeq for Chip-seq Peak Quantification

BAM files were uploaded into EaSeq (v1.111) as "Datasets" using the standard settings for Chip-seq data.
GRCh37 (hg19) tRNA sequences (n = 606) were downloaded as a "Geneset" from the UCSC Table Browser[@Karolchik2004], (available at <https://genome.ucsc.edu>).
High-confidence tRNAs (n = 416) identified in the GtRNAdb[@Chan2016] were extracted as a "Regionset".

Signal peak intensities surrounding tRNAs were quantified using the EaSeq "quantify" tool.
Here the default settings "Normalize to reads per million" and "Normalize counts to DNA-fragments" were left checked.
The default setting "Normalise to a signal of 1000 bp" was unchecked.
The window size was offset ±500bp from the start of each tRNA gene.
Outputs are referred to as "Q-values".

To quantify upstream and downstream signals, the "quantify" tool was used with adjusted window sizes.
The upstream region was defined as 500 bp preceding and the first nucleotide of tRNA loci.
Thus, the start position was offset to 0 bp, and the end position was offset to -500 bp.
The downstream region constitutes the 500 bp region beginning with the first nucleotide of tRNA gene body.
The start position was offset to 1 bp, and the end position was offset to 500 bp.

Following quantification, tRNA binding events were arranged in ascending order -DOX Q-value and visualised as heatmaps.
Data was also visualised with "average", and "overlay" EaSeq tools.

EaSeq[@lerdrup2016] is avaiable at <http://easeq.net>.

## Motif Analysis

Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation ChIP (MEME) Suite

## Statistics

Statistical tests and graphs were generated with R[@r] (v 4.2.3), R Studio[@rstudio] (v 2023.03.0.386) and the tidyverse[@wickham2019] package.

# Results

## Binding of FOXA1 and H3k27ac to tRNA Genes

To investigate the impact of FOXA1 on tRNA enhancers in ER+ MCF-7 cells, public ChIP-Seq datasets from Fu et al. (2019)[@fu2019] were interrogated.
In this paper, a doxycycline (Dox) inducible OE system was used to achieve FOXA1 OE akin to tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) MCF-7 cells[@fu2019].

FOXA1 and H3K27ac peaks of 416 high-confidence tRNAs were quantified relative to the ±500 bp flanking regions.
Peaks were classified as binding events if Q-values exceeded the median input values (-Dox = 0.391, +Dox = 0.375).

FOXA1 interacted with 73.8% of tRNAs and

H3k27ac interacted with 68.3%.
of tRNA genes

64.9% +DOX (Figure \@ref(fig:results-1)A).

Whereas input reads generated minimal peak enrichment (Supplementary Figure X).
The number of genes bound was unchanged by OE of FOXA1.

Mapped reads of FOXA1 and H3K27ac binding were visualised as heatmaps and ordered by increasing -DOX Q-value.
This revealed a concentration of FOXA1 and H3k27ac at approximately half of tRNAs, relative to ±10 kb flanking regions.
Upon FOXA1 OE, FOXA1 binding increased at a small proportion of tRNAs genes and H3K27ac binding decreases at approximately half of tRNA genes (Figure \@ref(fig:results-1)A).
This was confirmed by average signal intensity plots of FOXA1 and H3K27ac binding (Figure \@ref(fig:results-1)B).

Upon FOXA1 OE, the mean Q-values for FOXA1 binding significantly decreased 0.16-fold and insignificantly decrease by 0.62-fold for H3K27ac (Mann-Whitney: p \<0.005) (Supplementary Figures X).
However, there is a significant difference in binding between -DOX and +DOX tRNAs for both FOXA1 and H3K27ac (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test : p \<0.0001) (Figure \@ref(fig:results-1)C).
Changes in FOXA1 and H3K27ac binding has been visualised as a parameter heatmap in Figure \@ref(fig:results-1)D. Together, these results suggest that FOXA1 overexpression alters the binding landscape of FOXA1 and H3K27ac at tRNAs.

```{r results-1, out.width = '100%', fig.cap = "(B) Ratiometric heatmaps of the log2 ratio between the binding of FOXA1 or H3k27ac with endogenous FOXA1 expression vs. the binding of FOXA1 or H3k27ac with FOXA1 OE."}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/results-01.png")
```

## Figure 2

### Why?

FOXA1 OE alters binding at tRNAs (fig1).

### What?

Using Q-values, tRNAs that are differently enriched upon FOXA1 OE were categorised as 'GAIN' or 'LOSS'.
This discovered substantially more tRNAs with increased (GAIN) than decreased (LOSS) FOXA1 (96 vs. 23) (Figure \@ref(fig:results-2)A).
However, for H3K27ac, the number of tRNAs with an increase (GAIN) was comparable to those with a decrease (LOSS) (54 vs. 52)(Figure \@ref(fig:results-2)B).

Of the tRNAs which gained FOXA1, 14% also gained H3K27ac.
and 13.5% lost H3K27ac.
These co-binding events represent approximately 25% of all tRNAs that each gain H3K27ac or lose H3k27ac (Figure \@ref(fig:results-2)C).

Examples of these tRNAs are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:results-2)D.

### Suggests

FOXA1 alone is insufficient in increasing tRNA activity.

```{r results-2, out.width='100%', fig.cap = "(B) Ratiometric heatmaps of the log2 ratio between the binding of FOXA1 or H3k27ac with endogenous FOXA1 expression vs. the binding of FOXA1 or H3k27ac with FOXA1 OE."}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/results-02.png")
```

## Figure 3

How many genes are 'activated' by FOXA1?

What?

-   tRNAs were classified as 'active' if H3K27ac Q-values exceeded the median -DOX value (Q \> 1.81).

-   How many genes are 'active' in -DOX vs +DOX

    -   Number is similar

    -   Are +DOX genes the same genes?
        Compare -DOX and +DOX tRNA lists

    -   Parameter heatmap of GAIN/LOSS genes?

Suggests?

```{r results-3, out.width = '100%', fig.cap = "."}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/results-03.png")
```

## Figure ?

-   Relative position (not very interesting)

-   Binding at isotopes?
    Certain AA more up than others?

## Figure 4

#### Why?

### What?

MEME CentriMo to identify de novo motifs that are enriched at tRNAs which gain both FOXA1 and H3k27ac

-   relative to other tRNAS (gain/lose, lose/lose, lose/gain)

-   FOXA1 not enriched

-   Look at ERE, AP-1, others?

-   Top 3 motifs (fisher E values) - IRF7, ERR3, NR4A1

-   A and B box motifs as a control?
    How?

    -   All downstream

    -   tRNAs where 'matching sequences' all best matches = code for valine

    -   Branched amino acids associated with lower BC risk

#### Suggests?

```{r results-4, out.width = '100%', fig.cap = ""}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/results-04.png")
```

# Discussion

-   FOXA1 alone not efficient to increase activity

    -   p300

-   FOXA1 moves nucleosomes to make other TF accessible?

-   Loses fox = weak binding?

-   Dynamic vs stable marks

-   ATAC-seq
