@ARTICLE{Brooks1977,
title = "Continuous protein synthesis is required to maintain the probability of entry into {S} phase",
author = "Brooks, R F",
abstract = "``Normal fibroblast'' lines such as 3T3 cells arrest in the G0/G1 compartment of the cell cycle when starved of serum. Following readdition of serum and after a lag of 14 hr, the cells enter S phase with first-order kinetics. Cell cycle progress after stimulation is thus consistent with the existence of a single, rate-limiting random event (or transition) in G1 as proposed by Smith and Martin (1973). The addition of low concentrations of cycloheximide (33-100 ng/ml) at any time after the end of the lag phase brings about a rapid reduction (within 1-2 hr) of the rate constant for entry into S phase by an amount that is proportional to the inhibition of leucine incorporation. This suggests that the transition probability depends upon the continuous synthesis of a protein with a short half-life, or on some other unstable substance whose concentration is geared to the rate of translation. More importantly at present, the results indicate that the rate-limiting transition occurs within 2 hr of the start of DNA synthesis. When the same low concentrations of cycloheximide are added at the time of serum stimulation, they also lead to a marked elongation of the lag phase which again is related to the inhibitor concentration. This result is surprising since the lag is independent of serum concentration which itself influences the rate of protein synthesis.",

abstract = "The role of protein degradation in cellular proliferation was investigated by measurements of the rates of degradation of labile and stable proteins for a number of cell types under various growth conditions. The rate of protein degradation was found to be a relatively invariant parameter in that it did not change after strong inhibition of protein synthesis with cychloheximide or histidinol, it was the same in both exponential and stationary phase, and it did not correlate with the presence or absence of malignant transformation. Using three different cell types with widely differing division rates, the rate of cell division and DNA synthesis (in \%/hr) was found to be precisely equal to the rate of protein accumulation (in \%/hr) , i.e., to the rate of protein synthesis minus the rate of protein degradation. Division rates between the different cell types appeared to be determined chiefly by the rate of protein synthesis though, especially at low division rates, the rate of protein degradation could represent a large component of the protein accumulation rate.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: FOXA1, a forkhead family transcription factor, is essential for optimum expression of approximately 50\% of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha):estrogen responsive genes. FOXA1 is expressed in breast cancer cells. It segregates with genes that characterize the luminal subtypes in DNA microarray analyses. The utility of FOXA1 as a possible independent prognostic factor has not been determined in breast cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A tissue microarray comprising tumors from 438 patients with 15.4 years median follow-up was analyzed for FOXA1 expression by immunohistochemistry. Interpretable FOXA1 expression obtained in 404 patients was analyzed along with other prognostic factors like tumor grade, size, nodal status, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2/neu. RESULTS: FOXA1 expression (score >3) was seen in 300 of 404 breast cancers and it correlated with ER (P = 0.000001), PR (P = 0.00001), and luminal A subtype (P = 0.000001). Loss of expression was noted with worsening tumor grade (P = 0.001). Univariate analysis showed nodal status (P = 0.0000012), tumor size (P = 0.00001), FOXA1 (P = 0.0004), and ER (P = 0.012) to be predictors of breast cancer-specific survival. Multivariate analysis showed only nodal status (P = 0.001) and tumor size (P = 0.039) to be significant prognostic factors, whereas FOXA1 (P = 0.060) and ER (P = 0.131) were not significant. In luminal subtype A patient subgroup, FOXA1 expression was associated with better cancer-specific survival (P = 0.024) and in ER-positive subgroup, it was better predictor of cancer-specific survival (P = 0.009) than PR (P = 0.213). CONCLUSION: FOXA1 expression correlates with luminal subtype A breast cancer and it is significant predictor of cancer-specific survival in patients with ER-positive tumors. Prognostic ability of FOXA1 in these low-risk breast cancers may prove to be useful in clinical treatment decisions.",

abstract = "Transthyretin (TTR) and alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) are expressed at high levels in the liver and also in at least one other cell type. We report here a detailed analysis of the proximal regulatory region of the TTR gene, which has uncovered two new DNA-binding factors that are present mainly (or only) in hepatocytes. One of these new factors, hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF-3), binds to two sites that are crucial in TTR expression as well as to two additional sites in the alpha 1-AT proximal enhancer region. The second new factor, HNF-4, binds to two sites in TTR that are required for gene activity. We had previously identified binding sites for another hepatocyte-enriched DNA-binding protein (C/EBP or a relative thereof), and additional promoter-proximal sites for that protein in both TTR and alpha 1-AT are also reported here. From these results it seems clear that cell-specific expression is not simply the result of a single cell-specific factor for each gene but the result of a combination of such factors. The variation and distribution of such factors among different cell types could be an important basis for the coordinate expression of the TTR and alpha 1-AT genes in the liver or the discordant transcriptional activation of these genes in a few other cell types. The identification of such cell-enriched factors is a necessary prelude to understanding the basis for cell specificity.",

HNF3 and GATA-4, but not NF-1, C/EBP, and GAL4-AH, bound their sites in compacted chromatin and opened the local nucleosomal domain in the absence of ATP-dependent enzymes. The ability of HNF3 to open chromatin is mediated by a high affinity DNA binding site and by the C-terminal domain of the protein, which binds histones H3 and H4.

abstract = "Most transformed cells display abnormally high levels of RNA polymerase (pol) III transcripts. Although the full significance of this is unclear, it may be fundamental because healthy cells use two key tumor suppressors to restrain pol III activity. We present the first evidence that a pol III transcription factor is overexpressed in tumors. This factor, TFIIIC2, is a histone acetyltransferase that is required for synthesis of most pol III products, including tRNA and 5S rRNA. TFIIIC2 is a complex of five polypeptides, and mRNAs encoding each of these subunits are overexpressed in human ovarian carcinomas; this may explain the elevated TFIIIC2 activity that is found consistently in the tumors. Deregulation in these cancers is unlikely to be a secondary response to rapid proliferation, because there is little or no change in TFIIIC2 mRNA levels when actively cycling cells are compared with growth-arrested cells in culture. Using purified factors, we show that raising the level of TFIIIC2 is sufficient to stimulate pol III transcription in ovarian cell extracts. The data suggest that overexpression of TFIIIC2 contributes to the abnormal abundance of pol III transcripts in ovarian tumors.",

By analyzing the expression levels of tRNAs at the gene, codon, and amino acid levels, we identified unequal alterations in tRNA expression, likely due to the uneven distribution of tRNAs decoding different codons. We find that overexpression of tRNAs recognizing codons with a low observed-over-expected ratio may overcome the translational bottleneck in tumorigenesis. We further observed overall overexpression and amplification of tRNA modification enzymes, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and translation factors, which may play synergistic roles with overexpression of tRNAs to activate the translational systems across multiple cancer types.",

We adopted a Case-control (CC) and Case-Only (CO) association study designs. Risk scores constructed from tRNAs were subjected to univariate and multivariate Cox-proportional hazards regression to investigate their prognostic value. Of the 571 tRNAs profiled, 76 were differentially expressed (DE) and three were significant for OS in the CC approach. We identified an additional 11 tRNAs associated with OS and 14 tRNAs as significant for RFS in the CO approach, indicating that CC alone may not capture all discriminatory tRNAs in prognoses. In both the approaches, the risk scores were significant in the multivariate analysis as independent prognostic factors, and patients belonging to high-risk group were associated with poor prognosis. Our results confirmed global up-regulation of tRNAs in BC and identified tRNAs as potential novel prognostic markers for BC.",

Though components of the translation machinery are often misregulated in cancers, what role tRNA plays in cancer cells has not been explored. We compare genome-wide tRNA expression in cancer-derived versus non-cancer-derived breast cell lines, as well as tRNA expression in breast tumors versus normal breast tissues. In cancer-derived versus non-cancer-derived cell lines, nuclear-encoded tRNAs increase by up to 3-fold and mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs increase by up to 5-fold. In tumors versus normal breast tissues, both nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs increase up to 10-fold. This tRNA over-expression is selective and coordinates with the properties of cognate amino acids. Nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded tRNAs exhibit distinct expression patterns, indicating that tRNAs can be used as biomarkers for breast cancer. We also performed association analysis for codon usage-tRNA expression for the cell lines. tRNA isoacceptor expression levels are not geared towards optimal translation of house-keeping or cell line specific genes. Instead, tRNA isoacceptor expression levels may favor the translation of cancer-related genes having regulatory roles. Our results suggest a functional consequence of tRNA over-expression in tumor cells. tRNA isoacceptor over-expression may increase the translational efficiency of genes relevant to cancer development and progression.",

Many transformed cell types have elevated pol III activity, presumably to sustain sufficient protein synthesis for unrestrained growth. The retinoblastoma tumour-suppressor protein (Rb) restricts cellular proliferation, and is often found mutated in transformed cells. Here we demonstrate that Rb can repress the level of transcription from pol III templates both in vitro and vivo. Analysis of Rb-deficient SAOS2 cells and primary fibroblasts from Rb-/- mice demonstrates elevated levels of pol III activity in the absence of functional Rb protein. Rb-induced repression of pol III activity is alleviated by mutations in the Rb pocket domain that occur naturally in tumours, and by viral transforming proteins that bind and inactivate Rb. These results implicate repression of pol III transcription as a mechanism for Rb-induced growth arrest, and suggest that restraining protein biosynthesis may be important in the prevention of tumour development.",

Kouzarides, Nature 382:88-90, 1996). This regulation involves interaction with TFIIIB, a multisubunit factor that is required for the expression of all Pol III templates (C. G. C. Larminie, C. A. Cairns, R. Mital, K. Martin, T. Kouzarides, S. P. Jackson, and R. J. White, EMBO J. 16:2061-2071, 1997; W.-M. Chu, Z. Wang, R. G. Roeder, and C. W. Schmid, J. Biol. Chem. 272:14755-14761, 1997). However, it has not been established why RB binding to TFIIIB results in transcriptional repression. For several Pol II-transcribed genes, RB has been shown to inhibit expression by recruiting histone deacetylases, which are thought to decrease promoter accessibility. We present evidence that histone deacetylases exert a negative effect on Pol III activity in vivo. However, RB remains able to regulate Pol III transcription in the presence of the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. Instead, RB represses by disrupting interactions between TFIIIB and other components of the basal Pol III transcription apparatus. Recruitment of TFIIIB to most class III genes requires its binding to TFIIIC2, but this can be blocked by RB. In addition, RB disrupts the interaction between TFIIIB and Pol III that is essential for transcription. The ability of RB to inhibit these key interactions can explain its action as a potent repressor of class III gene expression.",

Although many studies have shown that p53 binds to TBP, the significance of this interaction has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that the TBP-p53 interaction is of functional importance for regulating RNA pol III-transcribed genes. Unlike RNA pol II-dependent promoter repression, overexpressing TBP can reverse inhibition of tRNA gene transcription by p53. p53 does not disrupt the direct interaction between the TFIIIB subunits TBP and Brf1, but prevents the association of Brf1 complexes with TFIIIC2 and RNA pol III. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found that TFIIIB occupancy on tRNA genes markedly decreases following p53 induction, whereas binding of TFIIIC2 to these genes is unaffected. Together our results support the idea that p53 represses RNA pol III transcription through direct interactions with TBP, preventing promoter occupancy by TFIIIB.",

Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18\%), followed by colorectal (9.4\%), liver (8.3\%), stomach (7.7\%), and female breast (6.9\%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2-fold for men and little for women.

abstract = "We report the immediate effects of estrogen signaling on the transcriptome of breast cancer cells using global run-on and sequencing (GRO-seq). The data were analyzed using a new bioinformatic approach that allowed us to identify transcripts directly from the GRO-seq data. We found that estrogen signaling directly regulates a strikingly large fraction of the transcriptome in a rapid, robust, and unexpectedly transient manner. In addition to protein-coding genes, estrogen regulates the distribution and activity of all three RNA polymerases and virtually every class of noncoding RNA that has been described to date. We also identified a large number of previously undetected estrogen-regulated intergenic transcripts, many of which are found proximal to estrogen receptor binding sites. Collectively, our results provide the most comprehensive measurement of the primary and immediate estrogen effects to date and a resource for understanding rapid signal-dependent transcription in other systems.",

abstract = "The transcription factor Forkhead-box A1 (Foxa1), a member of the FOX class of transcription factors, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung, esophageal and prostate cancers. We have recently identified transcriptional activation of p27 by FOXA1. In this study, we analyzed the activities and expression pattern of FOXA1 in breast cancer. Forced expression of FOXA1 inhibited clonal growth of breast cancer cell lines, and FOXA1 levels inversely correlated with growth stimuli. In the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 cells, FOXA1 increased p27 promoter activity and inhibited the ER pathway activity. Analysis of FOXA1 expression in breast tissue arrays revealed significantly higher expression in pure ductal carcinomas in situ compared to invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC); and in IDC, high expression of FOXA1 was associated with favorable prognostic factors. Yet, FOXA1 expression was noted in a subset of the ER-negative tumors. Taken together, our findings suggest a growth inhibitory role for FOXA1, and identify it as a novel, potential prognostic factor in breast cancer.",

abstract = "The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1 in human tumors and normal tissues was investigated using a panel of novel anti-p27kip1 mAbs. An inverse correlation between expression of p27kip1 and cell proliferation was generally observed after analyzing its expression in 25 different normal human tissues. In some highly proliferative human breast cancer cells, however, high level p27kip1 expression was seen, indicating the existence of a mechanism by which some growing tumor cells may tolerate this inhibitor of cell cycle progression. Detailed studies demonstrated a correlation between the high level expression of p27kip1 and cyclin D1 in human breast cancer cells. There was also an inverse correlation between the expression of p27kip1 and the degree of tumor malignancy in human breast and colorectal cancers, indicating that p27kip1 may be a useful prognostic marker in these cancers.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: p27kip1 (p27) plays an important role as a negative regulator of cell cycle-dependent kinase activity during progression of the cell cycle. The most important prognosticator of breast cancer is nodal status, and the aim of this study was to determine the prognostic implication of p27 in breast cancer patients with lymph node metastases. METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining for p27 was performed on tissues from 102 patients with node-positive breast cancer. RESULTS: A nuclear staining over 50\% was defined as high expression. High expression of p27 was shown in 59 patients (57.8\%). A significant correlation was found between high p27 and positive estrogen receptor status, but there was no correlation between p27 staining and age, menopausal status, nodal status, or tumor size. Low expression of p27 was significantly associated with shorter survival. A multivariate analysis also showed that the only independent variable was p27. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that low expression of p27 was an independent factor associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, p27 can be an important tool in making therapeutic decisions.",

@ARTICLE{Williamson2006,

author = "Williamson, E A and Wolf, I and O'Kelly, J and Bose, S and Tanosaki, S and Koeffler, H P",
abstract = "We have previously shown that the breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1, can transcriptionally activate the p27(Kip1) promoter. The BRCA1-responsive element was defined as a 35 bp region from position -545 to -511. We next determined that within this region is also a potential binding site for the transcription factor Forkhead box (FOX)A1. RNA and protein analysis as well as immunohistochemistry showed that expression of FOXA1 correlated with the expression of the estrogen receptor in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and tissues. In transient transfection reporter assays, FOXA1 could activate the p27(Kip1) promoter. Cotransfection of BRCA1 and FOXA1 resulted in a synergistic activation of the p27(Kip1) promoter. Mutation of the FOXA1 DNA-binding site in the p27(Kip1) promoter-luciferase construct significantly diminished the activity of FOXA1 alone or in combination with BRCA1. Cotransfection of FOXA1 and BRCA1 resulted in a greater amount of each protein compared to transfection of each expression vector alone. The half-life of FOXA1 was increased when coexpressed with BRCA1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis demonstrated that FOXA1 could bind to a wild-type oligonucleotide containing the FOXA1 binding site in the p27(Kip1) promoter, but this binding was lost upon mutation of this FOXA1 binding site. The protein-DNA binding complex could be supershifted with an antibody directed against FOXA1. The activity of the p27(Kip1) promoter as well as FOXA1 expression was reduced in cells treated with BRCA1 siRNA, thus silencing the expression of BRCA1 protein. In summary, we identified a FOXA1 binding site within the BRCA1-responsive element of the p27(Kip1) promoter and showed that FOXA1 activated the promoter alone and in conjunction with BRCA1. Furthermore, we identified high expression of FOXA1 in breast cancer cell lines and tissues, discovered a role for BRCA1 in the regulation of p27(Kip1) transcription and a possible interaction with BRCA1.",

abstract = "Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) is a pioneer factor of estrogen receptor $\alpha$ (ER)-chromatin binding and function, yet its aberration in endocrine-resistant (Endo-R) breast cancer is unknown. Here, we report preclinical evidence for a role of FOXA1 in Endo-R breast cancer as well as evidence for its clinical significance. FOXA1 is gene-amplified and/or overexpressed in Endo-R derivatives of several breast cancer cell line models. Induced FOXA1 triggers oncogenic gene signatures and proteomic profiles highly associated with endocrine resistance. Integrated omics data reveal IL8 as one of the most perturbed genes regulated by FOXA1 and ER transcriptional reprogramming in Endo-R cells. IL-8 knockdown inhibits tamoxifen-resistant cell growth and invasion and partially attenuates the effect of overexpressed FOXA1. Our study highlights a role of FOXA1 via IL-8 signaling as a potential therapeutic target in FOXA1-overexpressing ER-positive tumors.",
