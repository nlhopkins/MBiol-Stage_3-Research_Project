The Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα) drives the majority of breast cancers. The presence of ERα is prognostic of positive responses to endocrine therapies. However, up to 50% of tumours develop resistance to endocrine therapies within 5 years, highlighting the need for new therapeutic targets. The majority of ERα binding events are dependent on FOXA1, a pioneer factor capable of initiating chromatin opening and binding of oncogenic transcription factors. Recently, both ERα and FOXA1 have been shown to bind to tRNA genes, which are often overexpressed in cancers. However, the role of FOXA1 in tRNA transcription has not been determined.Through analysis of publicly available ChIP-seq datasets, it was demonstrated that FOXA1 co-binds with H3K27ac at a large proportion of tDNAs in MCF7 cells. FOXA1 overexpression (OE) in ERα cells drives chromatin activation in a subset of tDNAs, as inferred by H3K27ac. These tDNAs are were enriched in binding motifs for FOXA1, ERE, and ERα tethering proteins, providing evidence for both direct and indirect ERα binding. The evidence presented provides sufficient evidence to permit further investigation into FOXA1 as a driver of tRNA transcription regulation in tamoxifen-resistant cells.
